U1 &FUNCTIONALITY&                                                         
AS Some function are becoming flagged as obsolete in later SAP releases.   
   This class will wrap all functions that we are using in ABAP2XLSX in a  
   static method where we'll use the newer version that SAP suggests       
/  We'll keep the old function call as a comment in the method - that way  
   anyone installing on an older system may remove the comments to activate
   the previous coding
